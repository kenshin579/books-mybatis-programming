# SpringMVC-Mybatis-Helloworld

Helloworld integrating SpringMVC and Mybatis. I coded it to learn Mybatis-Spring and wrote this note - [Mybatis with spring](http://dongchuan.github.io/articles/2016/04/MyBatis-With-Spring.html).

This demo is mainly to try:

1. MapperScannerConfigurer to scan automatically mappers
2. How to define mappers with xml and annotation
3. The differences between Mybatis and Mybatis-spring about `SqlSessionFactoryBean` and `SqlSession`

It would be appreciated to indicate my mistake and understanding from freshman :D
